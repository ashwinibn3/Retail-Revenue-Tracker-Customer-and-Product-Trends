# Retail-Revenue-Tracker-Customer-and-Product-Trends

## Project Summary
Ever wondered which day of the week people shop the most, or which quirky product secretly drives the most revenue? I did too — and that’s how this dashboard came to life.
This Tableau dashboard was built using real-world online retail transaction data, with a major focus on the UK — where most of the revenue comes from. The goal was to uncover buying patterns, top-selling products, and revenue-driving customer segments to simulate decision-making for retail stakeholders.

## Dashboard Components
- KPIs : Revenue, Quantity Sold, Unique Customers, Orders  
- Bar Chart : Top 15 Products by Revenue  
- Treemap : Revenue by Weekday  
- Bar Chart: Top 10 Customers by Revenue
- Color Bar : Revenue by Region

## Key Insights
- UK accounted for the majority of revenue, reaffirming its dominance as the primary market  
- Thursdays consistently showed peak revenue, hinting at midweek buying momentum  
- Just 15 top-selling products generated over 50% of total revenue  
- A small group of countries contributed to most international sales  
- Repeat customers had significantly higher average order values  

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (data prep & cleaning)  
- Tableau Public (dashboard creation & publishing)
