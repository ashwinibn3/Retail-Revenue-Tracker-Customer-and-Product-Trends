# Retail-Revenue-Tracker-Customer-and-Product-Trends

## Project Summary
Ever wondered which day of the week people shop the most, or which quirky product secretly drives the most revenue? I did too — and that’s how this dashboard came to life.
This Tableau dashboard was built using real-world online retail transaction data, with a major focus on the UK — where most of the revenue comes from. The goal was to uncover buying patterns, top-selling products, and revenue-driving customer segments to simulate decision-making for retail stakeholders.

This project uses the [Online Retail Dataset] provided by (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)

## Dashboard Components
- KPIs : Revenue, Quantity Sold, Unique Customers, Orders  
- Bar Chart : Top 15 Products by Revenue  
- Treemap : Revenue by Weekday

## Key Insights
